This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
I used [auth0 blog](https://auth0.com/blog/react-tutorial-building-and-securing-your-first-app/) as the source for the authorization.
For the payment I used [fireship](https://fireship.io/lessons/paypal-checkout-frontend/)
Further down the line it will be implemented after the you ordered a package.

## How to test this locally

This is still work in progress, the goal is to integrate it with our linux servers.

Open it in visual studio code and type in the terminal.

### `npm install`

And then run the server.

### `node server`

Open another terminal and type.

### `cd client`
### `npm install`
### `npm start`


Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
